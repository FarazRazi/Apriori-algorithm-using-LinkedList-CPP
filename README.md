# Apriori algorithm using LinkedList CPP
## - Apriori algorithm was the first algorithm that was proposed for frequent itemset mining. 
## - This repo has functions that uses concepts of Data Science (Linked List) to implement a simple representation of Apriori algorithm in C++. 
## - Also the test casses are included that uses given .txt files to run those functions and validate the output.
